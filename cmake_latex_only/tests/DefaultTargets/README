This test checks to make sure that the appropriate targets are being made
by default for LaTeX documents with forced builds.

The following documents exist and the default targets (made with no
arguments to make) should create the following files (in addition to the
standard auxileary files). This is assuming LATEX_DEFAULT_BUILD is not set
to Ps or SafePdf.

NoDefault.tex:		-nothing-
DefaultDvi.tex:		DefaultDvi.dvi
DefaultPdf.tex:		DefaultPdf.pdf
DefaultHtml.tex:        DefaultHtml.html DefaultHtml.dvi

Looking at the transpose, here are the files expected per extention.

*.dvi:	DefaultDvi.dvi DefaultHtml.dvi
*.pdf:	DefaultPdf.pdf
*.html:	DefaultHtml.html
